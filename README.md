# xplore
Exploratory Data Analysis toolkit for Pandas tables.

xplore is a python package that aims to make Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) a bit easier. EDA, in case you are asking, is the process of investigating a dataset in order to develop an intiution that will help during subsequent steps. Basically, xplore contains wrappers for routine functions for data cleaning, feature transformations and visualizations. Importantly, the library also support a primitive versioning functionality that aims to (1) make EDA more reproducable and (2) compare between different preprocessing scenarios.


## Requirements

pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn and pickle.

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/fahd09/xplore.git
